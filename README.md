# voting_experiments
The project contains all (or at least I try to collect as many as possible) influential voting experiments in economic literature.
### Agranov et al (2018)*
* Agranov, M., Goeree, J.K., Romero, J. and Yariv, L., 2018. __What makes voters turn out: The effects of polls and beliefs__. *Journal of the European Economic Association*, 16(3), pp.825-856.
* In the original paper, the experiment was conducted in Ztree. Here is the oTree version.

### Levine and Palfrey (2007)*
* Levine, D.K. and Palfrey, T.R., 2007. __The paradox of voter participation? A laboratory study__. *American political science Review*, pp.143-158.
* In the original paper, the experiment was conducted in Multistage (http://multistage.ssel.caltech.edu/).
* I wasn't able to find the origin Multistage experiment, so the display and the wording are different from the origin one. However, I hope it has the spirit of the origin design.
* In this app, I set N=3 for the simplicity of debugging, which makes the toss-up (Session 1) and the landslide (Session 2) case identical. So I set N_A = 2 in Session 1 to check if some codes work.
