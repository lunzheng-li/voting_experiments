    <h3>Welcome to CASSEL</h3>
    <p class="justify">
        Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research experiment on group decision making. During the experiment we require your complete, undistracted attention. So we ask that you follow instructions carefully. Please do not open other applications on your computer, chat with other students, read books, or do homework. <br><br>

        For your participation, you will be paid in cash, at the end of the experiment. Different participants may earn different amounts. What you earn depends partly on your decisions, partly on the decisions of others, and partly on chance. So it is important that you fully understand the instructions before we begin. <br><br>

        The entire experiment will take place through computer terminals, and all interaction among you will take place through the computers. It is important that you not talk or in any way try to communicate with other participants during the experiments, except according to the rules described in the instructions. <br><br>

        We will start with a brief instruction period. During the instruction period, you will be given a complete description of the experiment. If you have any questions during the instruction period, raise your hand and your question will be answered out loud so everyone can hear. If any difficulties arise after the experiment has begun, raise your hand, and an experimenter will come and assist you privately.
    </p>
